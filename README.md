# keybase-kbfs-docker
Docker image for keybase's KBFS

### What's this?

This is a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image for [Keybase client](https://keybase.io) focused on getting access to [KBFS](https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs). The KBFS mount can optionally be seen from the host.

### Getting started

- Create an account on [Keybase](https://keybase.io)
- Generate a _paper key_ using the keybase CLI (you should use another device to do this). The paper key is just a series of words, that counts as a device in Keybase, and can be used for the "oneshot" feature used by the docker container.
- The recommended way to run the container is by using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). But before, you must create an `.env` file with the following contents:


```
# where the KBFS is mounted inside the container.
KEYBASE_KBFS_MOUNT=/kbfs

# the UID of the user who will run the container.
UID=1000

# to have container's time in sync with the host
TZ=your/timezone

KEYBASE_USER=your_keybase_user
KEYBASE_PAPERKEY=your keybase paper key
```

The UID variable is used by the entrypoint script to do some trickery to match the UID of the user unnig docker with the UID of the user inside the container. In most cases you don't need to change this, but it may happen that your user has an ID that is not 1000, so you'll have to change that value in the `.env` file.

After that, you can run `docker-compose up -d`. It uses the prebuilt image at [the Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/waldner/keybase/). The KBFS is mounted at `${KEYBASE_KBFS_MOUNT}` (`/kbfs`) inside the container.


### How to get the KBFS mount on the host

Create a file `docker-compose.override.yml` with the follwing contents:

```
services:
  keybase:
    volumes:
      - "/home/you/kbfs:${KEYBASE_KBFS_MOUNT}:shared"
```

With this you'll have the KBFS exposed at `/home/you/kbfs` on the host.

### Caveats

- To use a FUSE mount inside the container, the device `/dev/fuse` is exposed to the container, which also needs to have the `SYS_ADMIN` capability (and needs the `apparmor:unconfined` security option under Ubuntu). If you're exporting the KBFS mount back to the host and the container crashes without cleaning up, you might have to manually umount (ie `fusermount -u /home/you/kbfs`) the host mount point.

- If you try to do `ls /kbfs/private` you get the mostly unrelated error `ls: reading directory '/kbfs/private/': Input/output error`. This sort of makes sense, as the contents of that directory are, well, private, although the error message is highly misleading and might look like a genuine error (network or whatever). Turns out that inside `private/`, you can only access your own subdirectory, so you always have to specify at least that path (plus any further subpath you might want):

```
# this works, assuming your username is "fonzie":
$ ls /kbfs/private/fonzie     # or /kbfs/private/fonzie/whatever
```

Furthermore, remember that the kbfs mount must always be accessed with the user with UID 1000, both inside and outside the container (inside the container it's the user `keybase`, which you can su in to from root).
